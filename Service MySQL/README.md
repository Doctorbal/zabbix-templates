#### Version: 1.0.4 (2018-06-11)

#### Description:
MySQL engine monitoring over Zabbix agent.

#### Notes:
- Tested on MySQL 5.7 and it not uses MySQL 5.6 backward compatibility.  The
  template requires to disable MySQL 5.6 backward compatibility and it will
  raise alarm that show_compatibility_56 is OFF. To disable MySQL 5.6
  backward compatibility best to add in my.cnf:
```
[mysqld]
show_compatibility_56=OFF
```
- By default this template is monitoring the engine working on localhost
- To be able to use this template on a host you need to setup a monitoring account with the proper privileges. To add such account you can use below queries:
```
CREATE USER 'monitoring'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'monitoring';
GRANT SELECT, INDEX, SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'monitoring'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
